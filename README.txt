This library is a Javascript library to create two-dimensional vector
drawings.

The source files are separated to some degree for ease of maintenance. To
create a single, minified, file run the mk_drawlib2dv.sh file.
This uses an open-source minifier written in Python.

The source files include documentation inline. This is extracted during the
build process by running another python script.

There is an example web page example.html that demonstrates some usage of the
library. The Javascript sources for this are built by running mk_example.sh
which does not bother to minify them.

This software is available under a BSD license and all Javascript files
include the copyright and license.
